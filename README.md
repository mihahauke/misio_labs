# Metody Inteligencji Sztucznej i Obliczeniowej
![MISIO](bear.png)
This repository contains resources necessary to complete Artificial Intelligence courses (MISiO) at Poznan University of Technology.

# Python Package
To run some of the tasks python package will be needed. To install it use:
```
sudo pip3 install misio
```

# Grading
## tl;dr:
* you have to do **all** tasks
* delays are penalized
* cheating and sharing code will result in grade **2**

## Full 
>> "Unless stated otherwise in the task description" applies to all of the following points.
* **each** task has to be completed to <span style="color:green">pass</span>
 the course; failure to do so will result in <span style="color:red">**FAILING**</span> (getting grade 2) regardless of points gained from other tasks; 
* a task is considered completed if a solution is submitted and it scores at least **30%** of achievable points (after potential delay penalty)
* attendance gets you 1 point/class; in case of any doubts about scoring/cheating lack of attendance may result in disadvantageous consideration
* a solution has to be submited before a start of the next class; every started week of delay results in -20% penalty
* sharing your code or solutions is prohibited (you may however share your thoughts and ideas)
* submitting someone else's code may vary from getting 0 points or failing the whole course with no right to repeat
